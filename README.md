# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It provides a **GUI** for users to draw digits and get predictions using a pre-trained model.

## Features

- **Handwritten Digit Recognition**: Predicts digits (0-9) from drawn images.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with Tkinter, where users can draw digits and get predictions.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses a neural network model trained on the MNIST dataset.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
- Pillow (for image processing)

### Install Dependencies

1. Create a **virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
